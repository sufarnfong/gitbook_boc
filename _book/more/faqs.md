## Blockchain FAQs

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector.

### What problem blockchain solves?

Digital assets are easily copied and redistributed. On music and film industry it's a big problem, anyone can copy songs and movies and distribute them. Blockchain technology provides a database where is register every movement, and it can be distinguished when something is original or not. This is fits perfect with digital currency. We can distinguish one token (like a USDT) from another, assets can now be managed on a decentralized way.

### What is the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain?

Blockchain makes cryptos possible. It's what manage cryptocurrency. There is several blockchains networks, to use them is usual that you have to pay a gas fee, for this you need to pay on the native cryptocurrency. If you use the Polygon blockchain you need Matic to pay the fee. This fee is the incentive to people to participate on the process and contribute to the safety of the blockchain network.

### What are Decentralized Finances?

Decentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of real world finance but is created on the blockchain. It uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds to others, trade cryptocurrencies, and earn interest in savings-like accounts, all this without a centralized institution.

## Bank of Chain (BOC) FAQs

* BNB chain
* Ethereum
* Polygon

### What wallets are compatible with BOC?

### What stablecoins are incorporated for deposit on BOC?

BOC is on version beta 1.5 and receive [deposits](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/user-handbook/README.md#deposit) on USDT, USDC & DAI.

### Why BOC is secure?

BOC ensure it's safety being audited regularly as well as the integrated DeFi protocols. At the same time, BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions and the price quotation always relies on [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a market-leading oracle.

### What stablecoins can I deposit and withdraw?

BOC currently provides users to deposit and withdraw USDT, USDC and DAI in any combination and in any amount. When depositing stablecoins, USDi of equivalent value will be minted as a collateral, which will be burned when users want to withdraw their stablecoins.

### What is USDi? Can I use it to reinvest or do anything?

USDi is a collateral minted by users when they deposit stablecoins. The returns that users obtain via BOC protocol will be reflected in the increased amount of USDi in their wallet. USDi is pegged 1:1 as USD, in other word, it shows the user’s net USD value in BOC protocol. USDi is only a collateral which will be burned when withdrawing, it cannot be used for other financial activities.

### When will the BOC token be issued?

It will be issued in June 2022.

### How often will my balance increase once I have USDi or ETHi?

The amount of USDi or ETHi in your wallet will grow each time there is a positive rebase event. You can read more about this in [Rebase](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/protocol-algorithm-design/README.md#rebase). Currently, rebase are triggered once a day and is usually correlated with how many people are minting and burning in a day.

### What are the costs to mint and burn USDi and ETHi?

Anytime you mint or burn, there will be an exchange rate applied to your stablecoins deposited or withdrawn，and the exchange rate depends on [Oracles](appendix.md#oracle), which can be varied. See more details in [Mint & Burn](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/protocol-algorithm-design/README.md#mint--burn). The aim of this mechanism here is to protect the protocol from arbitrage, BOC protocol charge nothing in this process.

### Is there a minimum or maximum amount to deposit?

You can deposit any amount you want, there is no minimum or maximum limit.

### How much will I earn?

Each asset has its own market of supply and demand with its own APY (Annual Percentage Yield) which evolves with time. You can find the average annual rate over the past 30 days to evaluate the rate evolution, and you can also find more data on the reserve overview of each asset in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard-v1.bankofchain.io/#/) of BOC.
