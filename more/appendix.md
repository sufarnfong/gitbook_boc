## Glossary

### Blockchain network

Blockchain is a system that records information in a manner that causes it to be difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat on the system. Blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypts data blocks (smart contracts, transactions, etc.) and links them together to form a chronologically single source of accurate data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for most of the sectors. The blockchain community participates in this block by adding different consensus mechanisms.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a software platform that developers can use to create decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum. This virtual machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live.

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a native token on the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are typically minted with each new block added to the chain. For instance, each new block of Ethereum mined comes with a reward of two Ether tokens as compensation to the miner.

Cryptocurrencies are a type of token. Their nativity is their defining factor: other tokens are created using platforms and applications built on top of blockchains, while cryptocurrencies are built within a blockchain protocol.

### Consensus mechanism

A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies. It is most useful at record-keeping among all functionalities. At present, the most common mechanisms are the Proof of Work (PoW) and the Proof of Stake (PoS).

### Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of work is a consensus mechanism through which blocks are added to a blockchain. PoW requires miners to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, which demand large amounts of energy from powerful mining rigs in order to validate new blockchain transactions.

PoW is a safe and decentralized consensus mechanism, however it is notoriously inefficient. This is how Bitcoin and the first version of Ethereum blockchains operate although Ethereum will soon shift to the more efficient 'Proof of Stake’ protocol.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Confronted with the huge energy demands of PoW, proof of stake is an updated consensus mechanism that allows blocks to be mined much more efficiently. POS allows holders of a cryptocurrency to validate new blocks onto the relevant blockchain.

They do this by staking their cryptocurrency, i.e., they may have the opportunity to validate a new block, if their stake is chosen by a randomized algorithm, and they will be rewarded with cryptocurrencies for this. The more cryptocurrencies staked, the more chances the user has to be chosen to validate a new block.

Where PoW rewards those who have spent the most computational power to solve a cryptographic puzzle, PoS rewards those who invest their cryptocurrencies over a longer period of time.

### Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO)

It can be defined as an organization on a blockchain, represented by a set of rules encoded in a computer program on a blockchain, that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.

### DAOs Treasury

Treasuries help DAOs fund critical development, attract contributors and grow their network. Anything in DAO that can be automated should be, or else it should be funded by the treasury.

#### Principles of Treasury Management:

* Maintain an infinite time horizon: The treasury should be structured to exist in perpetuity (however, treasuries may be dissolved in certain situations).
* Ensure that the inflows exceed the outflows: Eventually, revenue from the protocol together with the returns of the treasury should exceed spending.
* Diversify: Treasury allocations should ensure that critical expenses can be funded even if the protocol token has a significant drawdown.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of finance created on the blockchain. It does not rely on financial institutions such as brokerages, exchanges or banks to provide financial tools, but it uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, trade cryptocurrencies and earn interest in savings-like accounts.

### Impermanent loss (IL)

Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes as compared to when you deposited them. The larger the changes, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss means less dollar value during withdrawal than during depositing. Impermanent loss is the risk that liquidity providers (LP) take in exchange for fees they earn in liquidity pools. If IL exceeds the fees earned by a user when they withdraw, this shows that the user has suffered negative returns as compared to simply holding their tokens outside the pool.

### Slippage

In crypto trade, slippage refers to the difference in price between the buyer and the seller expectations. Slippage can lead to a final sale price of the asset that is either more or less than the requested transaction amount.

### Dashboard

A crypto dashboard is a digital platform that lives on a website or in an app (either desktop or mobile). Its main function is to accept all the crypto accounts and/or coins you add to it to monitor their ever-shifting value, allowing you to manage and monitor both your crypto assets and related financial plans accordingly.

### Smart contract

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of agreement between the buyer and the seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed and decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is an autonomous trading mechanism that eliminates the need for centralized trading and related market-making techniques. It encourages users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a portion of the transaction fees and free tokens.

### Proactive Market Maker (PMM)

Essentially, the difference between this and AMM is that the algorithm checks the prices of assets allocating funds to proactively increase liquidity near the market price. An example of a DeFi that uses PMM is [DODO](https://dodoex.io/)

### Over-collateralized loans

Over-collateralization is a technique that may be used for credit enhancement. In this case, the issuer backs a loan with assets or collateral which has a value that is in excess of the loan. This limits the credit risk for the creditor and enhances the credit rating assigned to the loan.

### Protocol

Protocol is a set of codes or requirements that regulates blockchain operations. It displays a broad set of rules, such as the interface of the blockchain, the interaction of participating computers, the types of data that should be shared, Incentives for developers participating in the network and more.

### Lending Protocol

Lending Protocol is a platform composed of lenders and borrowers. It allows lenders to borrow cryptocurrencies from the platform and pay interest. Additionally, it allows depositors to deposit cryptocurrencies to the platform to earn interests. DeFi lending protocols can often offer much higher interest rates compared to bank deposit accounts.

### Collateral

In DeFi, collateral refers to the offer of one cryptocurrency or token as "collateral" to secure a different cryptocurrency or token loan.

### Volume

Volume refers to the amount of traded assets over a period of time, usually over the course of a trading day.

### Liquidity

Liquidity measures the circulating supply and how much trading activity there is in an exchange, economy, or network. A currency with low supply and/or circulation is said to be illiquid.

### Liquidity Pool

A Liquidity Pool is a pool of funds meant to provide liquidity to a currency, network, or Smart Contract. There are usually designed rewards or incentives given to those who provide liquidity to Liquidity Pools. See also (Liquidity Mining)\[].

### Yield Aggregators

Yield Aggregators is an aggregation platform that supports multiple DeFi protocols. It can automatically switch between various DeFi protocols that provide liquidity mining, helping users to obtain higher returns.

### Vault

Vault is a complex investment strategy that combines lending, staking, trading, etc. to maximize profits.

### Keeper

The centralized timer developed by the BOC project is used for timing triggering of on-chain tasks (harvesting, rebalancing, reinvestment of incremental funds, etc.).

### Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

Annual Percentage Yield is a standard of measuring how much money an investment account makes in a year. It also measures the rise in interest over time. The basic calculation formula is:

$$
APY=(1+APR)^{periods}-1
$$

Parameter “periods” is the interest payment periods.

### Strategy

Strategy refers to smart contracts that interface with third-party agreements. BOC Vault has multiple strategies, and the strategy is one-to-one with external third-party protocols.

### Oracle

Oracles are the bridge between the blockchain and the real world. Oracles act as on-chain APIs that can be queried for information regarding Smart Contracts including but not limited to price information. BOC uses [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a high-rated decentralized oracle, making oracle attacks really improbable.

### Arbitrage

Arbitrage involves buying and selling two related assets in two different markets in order to leverage the price or rate differential between the markets into risk-free profits. This, if not contemplated, can lead to asset losses in the vault. See more [here](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/protocol-algorithm-design/README.md#mint--burn-rules).

### Burn

Burning assets (coins or tokens) means eliminating USDi by sending them to a null address, which is not accessible by anyone since the private keys to that address are unowned. Users must burn the “tradable tokens” that attempt to accrue value in order to receive the “proprietary payment tokens” for the service in the network. In BOC, the users burn the USDi when they redeem and receive the stablecoins selected.

### Mint

In cryptocurrency, minting is a decentralized method that enables a person to generate new tokens without the involvement of a central authority, such as the government or the bank. It can either be a non-fungible token or a crypto coin. In BOC, the user mints USDi through Smart Contracts and they are transferred to their wallets when they deposit stablecoins.

### Stablecoin

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its value pegged to the value of a stable asset. Stablecoins are most commonly pegged to the US Dollar but it can also be pegged to other assets like gold or a basket of crypto assets.

### Circular dependencies

A circular dependency is a relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly. On DeFi multi-strategies protocols this would be when "protocol A" invest on "protocol B", at the same "protocol B" invest on "protocol A" leading to a real big risk for the protocol's stability.

### Token

Similar to a type of coin but with much greater functionalities. Tokens can also be used as a method of payment like coins. However unlike coins, they can excel at other cases of usage such as the democratic governance of a protocol or a system, or as means to use underlying coins to make liquidity tokens from these coin deposits.

### Governance Token

Governance token are tokens that carries the right to participate in the governance processes. Governance refers to determining, maintaining, adapting and enforcing the rules of a blockchain ecosystem, product, project or DAO.

### Lego Combination

A fundamental tenet in DeFi is to build for inter-operability. This allows the ecosystem to benefit from individual progress, continuously pushing decentralized finance. As participants build useful things, they can be shared and combined in new ways, reminiscent of everyone’s favourite toy, Lego. When new people dive into the Lego ‘bin’, they find individual Legos or preassembled combinations which they also start to build with, creating bigger and better things.

### Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

DEXs are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of crypto assets between many users through automated algorithms, instead of using the conventional approach by acting as a financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.

### Bridge

Blockchain bridges work just like the bridges we perceive in the physical world. Just as a physical bridge connects two physical locations, a blockchain bridge connects two blockchain ecosystems. Bridges facilitate the communication between blockchains through the transfer of information and assets.

### Wallet

A software application or hardware cryptocurrency wallet that can hold a variety of coins.
