# Rebase

When the total assets of the Vault are greater than the total issuance of USDi, this indicates that new income has been generated. Hence, the value of USDi compared to the US dollar will be revised, and the number of USDi will be increased, so that the total value of USDi is consistent with the total value of Vault assets, ensuring that 1 USDi is anchored at 1 USD. Concurrently, 20% of the additional USDi will be transferred to the DAO treasury as the management fee.
