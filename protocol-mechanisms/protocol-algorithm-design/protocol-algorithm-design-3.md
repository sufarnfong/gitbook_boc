# Rebase

When the total assets in the vault are greater than the total value of the USDi issuance, this indicates that new income has been generated. Consequently, the value of USDi compared to the US dollar will be revised (reset) and the issuance of USDi will be increased at the same time, in order to balance (equivalate) the total value of USDi and the total value of vault assets. This is to ensure that the price of USDi and USD is always fully-pegged (i.e., the exchange rate of USDi is maintained at around 1.0000). Concurrently, 20% of the additional USDi (USDi issued during rebase) will be transferred to the DAO treasury as the management fee.
