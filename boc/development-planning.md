## Future Planning

### Algorithm Optimization

At present, the adjustment algorithm only uses a function of scipy “minimize”. Global optimization, and non-convex optimization, are among all algorithms that can be considered.

### Additional Mainstream Blockchains

In the future, BOC plans to support more blockchains networks, such as Fantom, Avalanche, Solana, Arbitrum, etc.

### Additional Protocol Strategies

In the future, BOC also plans to support more protocol strategies that gain stable and competitive profit.

### Loan Protocol Support

By introducing a loan protocol, a liquidity pool is provided for BOC, and the leverage agreement can be accessed for strategic investments in the future. BOC introduces a lending protocol to add leverage when docking the protocol strategy, monitoring the relationship between market-making yield, mining coin yield, and lending rate in real-time, and also, to dynamically adjust the leverage multiple.

### Fiat Deposit Channels Support

1. Support bank account deposits and withdrawals;
2. Support credit card deposits and withdrawals;
3. Support payment software deposits and withdrawals;

### BOC debit card.

BOC plans to launch its own Debit Card for all users.

### Non-stablecoin Financial Management

1. Supports ETH farming and financial management.
2. Supports non-mainstream currency farming and financial management.
