# Protocol Algorithm Design

BOC provides the [USD Stablecoins Farming](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/how-it-works/Protocol-Algorithm-Design/README.md#usd-stablecoins-farming-mechanism) and [ETH Farming](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/how-it-works/Protocol-Algorithm-Design/README.md#eth-farming).

## USD Stablecoins Farming Mechanism

### Process Description

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Diagrama sin título.drawio.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. “Deposit” - The BOC protocol supports users with the `deposit` function - to deposit the three major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) in any desired combination and amount. BOC also allows minting of USDi of the corresponding value to be returned to the user.\
   “Withdraw” - Users can `withdraw` USDi which consists of the three major stablecoins at their convenience through the BOC protocol. By default, they will be returned according to the proportion of the three major stablecoins in the [Vault](../more/appendix.md#vaults) at that time, or they can specify a certain currency to be returned.
2. After the Vault receives the stablecoin, `queryTokenPrice` queries the price of the user's transfer of the [stablecoin](../more/appendix.md#stablecoin) through an external oracle. When the price returned by the [oracle](../more/appendix.md#oracle) is higher than 1 USD, it is calculated at 1 USD, whereas while it is lower than 1 USD, it is calculated at the price of the oracle.
3. Based on the calculated value, `mint/burn` will [mint/burn](../more/appendix.md#burnmint) an equivalent value of USDi tickets.
4. The [Keeper](../more/appendix.md#keeper) module reaches the trigger condition of `doHardWork` and triggers `doHardWork`.
5. After the Keeper trigger `doHardWork` the vault allocates the funds and exchange the USDi (burn) tickets for USDi (mint)
6. Vault calls the aggregate exchange module `swapTokenToWants`.
7. The aggregated exchange module `swapTokens` completes the exchange.
8. Vault receives the targetted currency exchanged by the aggregate exchange module.
9. Vault puts stablecoin `deposits` into the strategy according to the currency required by the strategy.
10. The [strategy](../more/appendix.md#strategy) invests stablecoin `deposits` into third-party protocols.
11. The Keeper module reaches the `harvest` trigger condition and triggers the `harvest`.
12. Harvester triggers each strategy to execute `harvest`.
13. Each strategy executes `claimRewards` to collect mining.
14. Each strategy transfers mining coins `transferRewards` to Harvester.
15. Harvester sells miner `sellRewards` into stablecoins through aggregated exchange.
16. Harvester `sendProfitToVault` transfers stablecoins into Vault.
17. The Keeper module reaches the `rebase` trigger condition and triggers the `rebase`.
18. Vault calls `changeTotalSupply` to issue additional USDi.
19. Vault collects 20% of the yield, which is transferred to the `Treasury`.
20. The [treasury](../more/appendix.md#daos-treasury) will benefit users from using `buyback` to repurchase the BOC governance token.

### Mint & Burn rules

Here is a numerical example of minting and burning USDi tokens.

Assume that Alice deposits 100 USDT, 100 DAI and 100 USDC.

According to the BOC mint rule: the transaction price is 1 USD when the price from Chainlink is higher than 1 USD. Otherwise, the transaction price is equal to the price from Chainlink.

Thus, Alice will `mint` 299 USDi in total:

The current price from Chainlink is:

* 1 USDT = 1.01 USD
* 1 DAI = 0.99 USD
* 1 USDC = 1.00 USD

100 USDT = 100 x 1.00 = 100 USDi (price of Chainlink > 1 USD final price = 1 USD)\
100 DAI = 100 x 0.99 = 99 USDi (price of Chainlink < 1 USD final price = Chainlink price)\
100 USDC = 100 x 1.00 = 100 USDi (price of Chainlink = 1 USD final price = 1 USD)

![](../.gitbook/assets/mint.png)

Now, Alice decides to `burn` the USDi to withdraw her stablecoins. She has 299 USDi now and when she burns depending on the proportion of USDT/USDC/DAI of the Vault. The burning smart contract will distribute the same proportion the USDi on each stablecoin. In this case when we redeem there is slightly less USDT on the Vault, so the distribution will be 99 of them for USDT, 100 for DAI, and the rest 100 for USDC (assuming that the current price from Chainlink remains unchanged).

The rule of burning is opposite to that of minting: the transaction price is 1 USD when the price from Chainlink is less than 1 USD. Otherwise, the transaction price is equal to the price from Chainlink.

Therefore, Alice burns 299 USDi to withdraw:

Chainlink prices:

* 1 USDT = 1.01 USD
* 1 DAI = 0.99 USD
* 1 USDC = 1.01 USD

100 USDi = 100/1.01 = 99 USDT (price of Chainlink > 1 USD final price = Chainlink price)\
100 USDi = 100/1.00 = 100 DAI (price of Chainlink < 1 USD final price = 1 USD)\
100 USDi = 100/1.00 = 100 USDC (price of Chainlink = 1 USD final price = 1 USD)

![](../.gitbook/assets/burn.png)

The numbers in the chart here are only numerical examples for a better understanding of the rules of minting and burning in BOC. In reality, the fluctuation of USDi is much smaller, indicating that users will never encounter such possible loss. In fact, the possible loss here will be less than 0.01%. The objectives of these rules are to avoid arbitrage and to protect the protocol's vault.

### Harvest

The `harvestTrigger` is triggered daily to determine whether the `harvest` conditions are met. The two conditions are:

1. Maximum time interval is exceeded.
2. The harvest rules are met:

$$
Profit \times 20\% > harvest cost
$$

If any of the above conditions are met, the strategy can perform `harvest`:

1. Execute the yield transfer Harvester (for the strategy with yield production and reach the yield selling threshold);
2. Report the current asset from the strategy.

### Rebase

When the total assets of the Vault are greater than the total issuance of USDi, this indicates that new income has been generated. Hence, the value of USDi compared to the US dollar will be revised, and the number of USDi will be increased, so that the total value of USDi is consistent with the total value of Vault assets, ensuring that 1 USDi is anchored at 1 USD. Concurrently, 20% of the additional USDi will be transferred to the DAO treasury as the management fee.

### Fund Allocation

#### doHardWork

The inputs into the position adjustment of the algorithm are the official [APY](../more/appendix.md#annual-yield-apy) of the third-party protocol, the gas required for investment of each strategy, the limit of exchange [slippage](../more/appendix.md#slippage), and the [rules of fund allocation](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/how-it-works/introduction-to-boc/README.md#fund-allocation-rules). Meanwhile, the strategy and amount of the funds to be invested are the outputs.

#### Allocation

Compared with `doHardWork`, `allocation` has an additional step: it withdraws the funds of the low APY strategy, then uses the official APY of the third-party protocols, the gas required for investment of each strategy, the exchange slippage limit, fund allocation rules, and the position adjustment algorithm as inputs, and the outputs are the strategy and the amount of the awaiting investment funds.

**Profit before position adjustment**

$$
gain1 = \frac{asset1 \times apr1 \times durationDays}{yearDays}
$$

**Changed earnings**

$$
gain2 = \frac{(asset1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)\times apr2 \times durationDays}{yearDays}
$$

**Changed apr**

$$
apr2 = \frac{apr1 \times poolAssets1}{(poolAssets1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)}
$$

After substituting apr2 in gain2 using the above equation:

$$
gain2=\frac{apr1 \times durationDays/yearDays \times (asset1+deltaAsset) \times poolAssets1}{poolAssets1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss}
$$

Hence the relationship between the changed income of a single strategy and the changed assets is:

$$
deltaGain = gain2-gain1 = \frac{deltaAsset \times (poolAsset1-asset1) \times apr1 \times durationDays}{(poolAsset1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss) \times yearDays}
$$

lendFee= gasPrice \times lendGas

Find the maximum sum of `deltaGain` for all strategies:

$$
profitChange=MAX\sum_{i=1}^m(deltaGain_i -withdrawFee_i-lendFee_i - exchangeLoss_i-harvestFee_i)
$$

$$
profitChange=MAX\sum_{i=1}^m(\frac{deltaAsset_i \times (poolAsset_i-asset_i) \times apr_i * durationDays_i}{(poolAsset_i+deltaAsset_i-exchangeLoss_i) \times yearDays_i}
$$

$$
- operateFee_i - exchangeLoss_i - harvestFee_i)
$$

In the formula above (profitChange), the only variable is the deltaAsset for each strategy. Meanwhile, the solution needs to be limited by:

**Restrictions**

1. The same protocol strategy (multiple constraints) funds do not exceed 30% of the total funds.
2. The sum of all asset changes in and out is 0.

**Boundary conditions**

1. Strategic assets do not exceed 20% of the total assets.
2. The strategic funds do not exceed 50% of the targetted pool assets.

Use python scipy's `optimize.minimize` to find the current optimal rebalancing scheme.

#### Official APY Calculation Rules

The official APY rules are needed as a reference when allocating funds. The sources of official APY are as follows: vfat.tools, coingecko, zapper, Official APY, apy.vision Fee, etc. If the APY calculation of the protocol strategy is not included in the official APY source channel, BOC will copy the official APY calculation rules of the protocol strategy. In general, the official APY of the protocol strategy consists of market-making revenue and mining coin revenue. Taking the “ConvexLusdStrategy” strategy that BOC has already docked as an example, its APY consists of the contents in following table:

| APY Mark | APR         | APY              | Compound Interest | Calculation Method   | Data Source                                                                        |

$$
APY=(1+APR)^{periods}-1
$$

The “periods” parameter is the interest payment period.

#### Strategy Actual APY Calculation Rules

The actual APY of the strategy is calculated based on the standard return of the strategy currency.

## ETH Farming Mechanism

The mechanism of ETH farming is exactly the same as that of the USD stablecoins farming at present. The only difference is that the collateral of USD stablecoins is USDi, thus that of ETH is called ETHi.
