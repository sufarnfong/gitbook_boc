# Protocol Components

## Incorporated Blockchains

BoC protocol is designed to be compatible with [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](../more/appendix.md#ethereum-virtual-machine-evm). In fact, BoC is connected with the Ethereum chain.

### Ethereum

[**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform with [smart contract](../more/appendix.md#smart-contract) functions, which native [cryptocurrency](../more/appendix.md#cryptocurrency) is ETH. In December 2021, Ethereum became the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, and also became the most widely used blockchain.

The concept of Ethereum was first proposed between 2013 and 2014 by the programmer Vitalik Buterin after being inspired by Bitcoin as "the next generation of cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform". Ethereum's development started through the ICO crowdfunding in 2014.

Ethereum is also known as the "second-generation blockchain platform", second only to Bitcoin.

### Polygon

[**Polygon**](https://wallet.polygon.technology/) is a protocol for building and interconnecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. The project was launched in India in 2017 under the original name Matic Network. In February 2021, the project name was changed to Polygon. The cryptocurrency of the Polygon project is MATIC, one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap traded on major exchanges.

## Incorporated Stablecoins

To avoid psychological fear caused by the fluctuations of digital currency value and the losses of market-making funds, BoC has selected only stable currency assets([stablecoins](../more/appendix.md#stablecoin)), and is only limited to those with full [collateral](../more/appendix.md#collateral) provided by fiat currency or by stablecoins.

Stablecoins need to meet the following conditions:

* The corresponding issuers should pass the due diligence check of BoC.
* Algorithmic stablecoins are strictly prohibited.
* Insurance is available.
* Stablecoin quotes must be based on ChainLink.
* Market capital has to be greater than $500 million / 200,000 ETH.

The (currently) selected strategic stablecoins are: DAI, USDC, USDT, BUSD, TUSD, LUSD, GUSD, SUSD.

### DAI

[**DAI**](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency designed to keep its value as close to a dollar as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

### USDC

[**USD Coin**](https://www.centre.io/usdc) (USDC) is a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar that operates on the Ethereum, Stellar, Algorand, Hedera Hashgraph, and Solana blockchains. As of 31st August 2022, USDC in circulation is $52.2 billion.&#x20;

### USDT

[**USDT**](https://tether.to/en/), also known as USDT, is a controversial cryptocurrency issued by Tether Limited, which is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. USDT is a stable currency. As being launched in 2014, USDT is a blockchain-based platform that digitally facilitates the use of fiat currencies.&#x20;

### BUSD

[**Binance USD**](https://www.binance.com/en/busd) (BUSD) is a new stablecoin launched by Binance and Paxos, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

### TUSD

[**TrueUSD**](https://www.trusttoken.com) (TUSD) is a stablecoin issued by Trusttoken, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

### LUSD

[**LUSD**](https://www.liquity.org/) is a stablecoin issued by the Liquidity Protocol, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

### GUSD

****[**Gemini Dollar**](https://www.gemini.com/dollar) (GUSD) is a stablecoin issued by Gemini, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

### SUSD

[**SUSD** ](https://synthetix.io/)is a synthetic U.S. dollar token issued by the Synthetix protocol, which is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The supported tokens are dynamic. The new supported tokens can be added or old ones could be removed through the interface after the protocol has been deployed.
{% endhint %}

## Keeper

The private key of the Keeper account is controlled by the team, which is a relatively centralized design. The authorization of the keeper is carried out through the `AccessControlProxy`, which can authorize the specified account or remove the authority of the specified account.

## Protocol strategy selection

After selecting a stablecoin, its corresponding strategies should meet the following conditions:

* Do not require deposit or withdrawal fees.
* No lock-up period, hence funds can be withdrawn rapidly.
* No limitations on the amount of funds for an investor.
* All protocols should be audited to avoid potential losses caused by code vulnerabilities to the greatest extend.
* The aggregated financial management protocol should count on a long-term safety operation record and obtain the communities' permission via voting. Therefore, the risks caused by nested tokens and LEGO combinations can be circumvented.
* Do not use protocols that obtain/magnify capital returns by providing unsecure services or leverage.
* The first accessed DEX and lending protocol should be the preferred first-line protocols on every blockchain and also count with reliable safety operation records.
* The protocol should allocate the funds intelligently, which always obeys two rules: maximizing yields and decentralizing capital risks.

The following are the selected protocols at present:&#x20;

* In Ethereum: Balancer, Convex, DODO, UniswapV2, UniswapV3, etc.
* In Polygon: Aave, Balancer, Curve, DODO, etc.&#x20;

### Aave

[**Aave**](https://app.aave.com/) is an open-source decentralized lending protocol that provides users with deposit and lending services. The deposit and loan interest rates of users on both sides of the borrower and the lenders are calculated by algorithms based on the platform's borrowing volume and deposit volume. The platform uses Chainlink's oracle to ensure fairness of the collateral price.&#x20;

### Aura

[**Aura**](https://aura.finance/) Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into veBAL) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Auraâ€™s native token.&#x20;

### Balancer

[**Balancer**](https://balancer.fi/) is a [decentralized exchange](../more/appendix.md#decentralized-finance-defi) deployed on Ethereum. Balancer uses automatic market makers to achieve the function of decentralized transactions. Transaction users can choose trading pairs to trade and pay transaction fees, while liquidity providers can get a share of the fees.&#x20;

### Convex

[**Convex**](https://www.convexfinance.com/) is a one-stop platform for CRV staking and liquidity mining on Ethereum that is dedicated to ease the use of Curve. As a yield aggregator on the Ethereum chain, Convex aims to use the CVX token to simplify the process of locking and staking Curve and CRV through an easy-to-use interface, and to improve the compensation of CRV token holders and liquidity providers. This facilitates the development of the CRV ecosystem.

The following two strategies with specialities are highlighted and explained in detail as below:

#### **ConvexIbUsdtUnderlyingStrategy**

**Investing logic**

**Deposited tokens**: USDT

**Withdrawn tokens**: USDT

In order to avoid the risk exposure of holding foreign exchange tokens, foreign exchange will be borrowed by mortgaging USDT in the IronBank protocol.

**Fund investment**:&#x20;

The invested USDT will be invested in the IronBank protocol as collateral, maintaining a borrowing rate of around 75% to borrow foreign tokens. The foreign token is then deposited as a single currency into the Curve pool, and the lpToken obtained from the Curve pool is then staked into the Convex protocol.

**Fund redemption**:

Redeem ibForex from the Curve pool and repay the same percentage of debt to redeem the USDT collateral.&#x20;

**decreaseBorrow**:

When the borrowing rate of the strategy exceeds 80%, the keeper will trigger the `decreaseBorrow()` method of the contract;

* The current borrowing rate is low, indicating that the US Dollar value of foreign exchange is low. The strategy will continue to borrow ibForex from Ironbank and deposit into Curve, then staking the lpToken obtained from the Curve pool to the Convex protocol.

#### **ConvexIbUsdcUnderlyingStrategy**

**Investing logic**

**Deposited tokens**: USDC

**Withdrawn tokens**: USDC

In order to avoid the risk exposure of holding foreign exchange tokens, foreign exchange will be borrowed by mortgaging USDC in the IronBank protocol.

**Fund investment**:&#x20;

The invested USDC is divided into two parts:

* Part 1: Constituting 40% of the invested capital, keeping USDC unchanged
* Part 2: Constituting 60% of the invested capital, and is deposited into the IronBank protocol as collateral, borrowing a foreign exchange worth $$60\% \times 0.75=0.45$$ maintaining a lending rate of around 75%).&#x20;

Part 1 and Part 2 is then combined and deposited into the Curve pool, staking the lpToken obtained from the Curve pool into the Convex protocol.

**Fund redemption**:

Redeem the two tokens from the Curve pool in equal proportions: USDC, ibForex, and repay the debt proportionally. If the previously redeemed ibForex is insufficient to repay the debt, the USDC will be exchanged for ibForex in the current Curve pool. After repaying the debt in equal proportions, draw out that proportion of collateral from IronBank, and finally transfer the USDC to the vault.

**rebalance**:

When the borrowing rate of the strategy exceeds 80% or falls below 60%, the keeper will trigger the rebalance method of the contract.

* If the current borrowing rate is lower, this indicates that the US Dollar value of foreign exchange is low, which further means that there are more ibForex and less USDC in the Curve pool. The strategy will draw out excess collateral - USDC, and directly deposit the  single currency USDC into the Curve pool (The less tokens you deposit into the pool, the more LP will be obtained).
* If the current borrowing rate is high, this indicates that the US Dollar value of foreign exchange is high, which further means that there are less ibForex and more USDC in the Curve pool. The strategy will redeem the single currency USDC from the Curve pool (the more currencies in the single currency redemption pool, the amount that can be obtained will also be more) and the redeemed USDC is invested in IronBank to increase collateral. However, if the overall mortgage rate exceeds 80%, the above logic will no longer be applied, but dual currency will be redeemed from the Curve pool in proportion, and dual currency will also be used to repay debt and to increase collateral.

### Curve

[**Curve**](https://curve.fi/) is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. Curve is designed for trading between stablecoins with low fees and slippage through an Automated Market Maker(AMM) protocol. It is a decentralized liquidity aggregator. Anyone can add their own assets into the liquidity pool to earn market-making benefits.&#x20;

### dForce

[**dForce**](https://dforce.network/) is committed to building an integrated and interoperable matrix of open financial protocols and currency protocols, including lending protocols (global liquidity pools, interest-earning markets), asset-based protocols (multi-currency stablecoins, synthetic assets, etc.), liquidity aggregators, Automatic Market Makers, etc.&#x20;

### DODO

[**DODO**](https://app.dodoex.io/) is a decentralized trading platform that uses an original Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, allowing everyone to issue and trade Web3 assets easily. DODO not only provides liquidity but also aggregates the liquidity of other exchanges. This allows DODO to offer the best prices on the entire network.&#x20;

### Lido

****[**Lido** ](https://lido.fi/)is the leading liquid staking solution - providing a simple and secure way to earn interest on your digital assets. By staking with Lido your assets remain liquid and can be used across a range of DeFi applications, earning extra yield.

### RocketPool

****[**RocketPool**](https://rocketpool.net/#header) is a first of its kind ETH2.0 Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum 2.0. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH2.0 development.

### Uniswap

[**Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.&#x20;

There are currently three versions of the Uniswap protocol. UniswapV1 and [UniswapV2 ](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2)are open-source and licensed under GPL. [**UniswapV3** ](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3)is open-source with slight modifications. Each version of Uniswap, once deployed, will function in perpetuity, with 100% uptime, provided the continued existence of the Ethereum blockchain.

#### UniswapV3

**Investing logic**

**Deposited tokens**: ETH + rETH or stablecoin pairs

**Withdrawn tokens**: ETH + rETH or stablecoin pairs

**Fund investment**:&#x20;

Invest in the corresponding token pair(s) pool according to the proportion in the pool.

**Fund redemption**:

Remove liquidity from the protocol pool, and transfer the obtained token pair(s) to the vault.

**Passive rebalancing**:

The strategy will set two Positions:

* Base Position: Place an order symmetrically revolving the current price according to the base threshold
* Limit Position: To place an order according to the limit threshold, either slightly higher or lower than the current price. This Position assists the strategy to rebalance, enabling the token pair's ratio to approach 50:50.&#x20;

Every 24 hours, the keeper will call the rebalance method, which will not swap tokens at runtime, but will adjust the Base Position and Limit Position according to the updated price and token balance. The Limit Position is as close to the current market price as the limit order. If the price moves in this direction, the second position will also be active, receiving a transaction fee.

### YearnV2

****[**Yearn** ](https://v2.yearn.finance/)Finance is DeFiâ€™s premier yield aggregator. Giving individuals, DAOs and other protocols a way to deposit digital assets and receive yield. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.&#x20;

## Incorporated Oracle

Oracles are data sources that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information in order for users to be able to query data in smart contracts. It allows certain smart contracts to respond to the uncertain external world, and it is the only way for smart contracts to interact with the outside world. It is also the interface between blockchain and the real world.

### Chainlink

[**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/) is a decentralized oracle network that bridges the gap between smart contracts (like those on Ethereum) and their external data. The blockchain itself cannot connect to external applications in a trusted manner. Chainlink is not a single network of oracles, but an ecosystem of many decentralized oracle networks running in parallel, whose token is LINK.
